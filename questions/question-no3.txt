The compiler code you've provided doesn't explicitly perform many optimizations directly, but there are some aspects that can be considered as optimizations or enhancements in the broader context of how the code handles the mini-program. Here are the optimizations or improvements that are present in the code:

1.Error Handling:
   - The use of `error()` for immediate error reporting and termination of the program when encountering unexpected or invalid conditions helps to avoid further processing of incorrect code, which optimizes the handling of invalid inputs or programs.

2.Lexical Analysis (Lexing Efficiency):
   - The `lex()` function processes the input string in a single pass, identifying tokens while skipping over spaces and comments without needing to revisit characters. This is a typical efficiency in lexers, reducing the number of passes over the input string.

3.Recursive Descent Parsing with Lookahead:
   - The parser uses a predictive, recursive-descent approach with lookahead (`peek()` function). By checking the next token ahead of time, it avoids unnecessary backtracking and directly identifies the grammar rule to apply based on the current token, which speeds up the parsing process.

4.Symbol Table Construction:
   - The `build_symtab()` function builds the symbol table efficiently by iterating through the declarations and storing the variable types. It also ensures that variables are not redeclared, preventing unnecessary reprocessing of symbols and avoiding potential errors during compilation.

5.Type Checking with Early Error Detection:
   - The type checking phase (`typecheck()`) ensures that operations are performed only between compatible types. If there's a type mismatch (for example, trying to assign a `float` to an `int` variable), the code terminates early with an error, avoiding incorrect execution. This prevents errors from propagating further and optimizing correctness in the code execution.

These optimizations focus on improving the efficiency, correctness, and reliability of the compiler's operation, especially in token parsing, error handling, and type consistency.
